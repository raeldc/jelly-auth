An extension of The [Kohana 3 Auth module](http://github.com/kohana/auth) for use with [Jelly](http://github.com/jonathangeiger/kohana-jelly) User models.

This module is just a Jelly port of [Sprig Auth](http://github.com/banks/sprig-auth) driver by @[banks](http://github.com/banks) who in turn based his sprig-auth from Kohana's [ORM auth driver](http://github.com/kohana/auth).
